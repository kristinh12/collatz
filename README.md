Collatz

This is an algorithm that will create the Collatz sequence.

A Collatz sequence takes a number, and divides by 2 if it is even, or multiply by 3 and add 1 if it's odd.  This continues until you reach the value 1.

I also included a method to find the longest_sequence up to a given value. It will return the value, and the length of the sequence.
